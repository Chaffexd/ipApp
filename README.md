# ipApp

> The idea behind this was to make and understand my own app that returned my IP for a useful function at work. I disliked Googling everytime "What is my IP?" so I thought, I'll make own and bookmark it. I could have done this with the first Google search but that doesn't help me learn, does it? 

## How to use
> Once you navigate to the site, it automatically works. No permissions needed. I am utilising an API from ipdata to retrieve the api on pageload and display it to the user on the site card. I then use another API to generate your location on a map this time. This will show you a very general area of where you are automatically using Mapbox. I use the coordinates generated in ipdata to pass that as the geolocation of the user in Mapbox so generate the map. 
>
>There is also a raw data tab that will show you the response from the API. This will show you a lot more information that is generated from the user.
